#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This problems in this course were all based on using different data structures and algorithms used to efficiently operate these data structures. The assignments were all about parsing through a file, storing, and then retrieving the data.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I apporached the problems by first researching the data structure being used that week. Once I had a better understanding of the data structure I was then able to begin writing up the code needed to solve the problem. One big takeaway was that most problems have already be solved and it comes down to using your resources to find the best way to solve the problem you are presented with.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The issues I ran into were easily solved through a quick google search, stack overflow, or reddit. Between these three you can more of less find a solution to just about any problem or at the very least get a good starting point to then figure it out yourself.

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project really opened me up to the many different data structures before this I was only really familiar with arrays, vectors, and dictionaries (in python). This course taught me about many differnt data structures and gave me practical experience in them as well. In this case I used a Binary Search Tree, a completely new concept to me that I really enjoyed because of the simplicity it offers when adding new objects, while also easily sorting the objects.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has given me an idea of what makes a system efficient. Learning to calculate runtime has shifted my understanding of design and given me the ability to start recognizing whether a certain design is inefficient. This will allow me to better plan a system by helping me choose the best data structure for a specific problem. At the end of the day this project has given me many more tools for my toolbag that I will be able to implement into every system I work on from here on.
